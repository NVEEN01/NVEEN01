- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know the first computer "bug" was an actual bug? 🦋 In 1947, a team led by computer scientist Grace Hopper found a moth causing issues in the Harvard Mark II computer. They humorously logged it as the "first actual case of bug being found." And just like that, the term "bug" became a part of programming history!
